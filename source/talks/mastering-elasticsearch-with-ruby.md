## Talk Abstract

Users have come to expect state-of-the-art search features in every part of their online experience. The good news for developers is that features like autosuggest, spell-correct, and personalized search are becoming easier to develop thanks to services like Elasticsearch. Integrating Elasticsearch into ruby apps is now relatively straightforward thanks to the Tire wrapper library. The talk will examine how to build an Elasticsearch cluster, create indexes, load data, and format and execute robust search features using the ruby Tire library.
