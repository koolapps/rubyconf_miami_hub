## About the speakers

Captain Eric Hodel be a long-time Rubyist with a strong interest in distributed programming. Besides maintaining RubyGems and RDoc, he has also contributed documentation to DRb and Rinda, reviewed The dRuby Book, implemented drbdump and added multicast support to Rinda’s service discovery (upcoming in Ruby 2.1).

Admiral Davy Jones^W Stevenson has used DRb to develop distributed systems for a number of years, and has been terrorizing the Ruby community into playing Spaceteam since early 2013. She encouragingly said ‘You should do that’ when Eric mentioned the idea of drbdump.

When he isn't busy buckling swashes or hauling keels, you can find First Mate Rein Henrichs building high-performance distributed systems in Ruby. When Davy told him she was building a pirate-themed Spaceteam with DRb, he said 'Can I help? I like yelling!'
