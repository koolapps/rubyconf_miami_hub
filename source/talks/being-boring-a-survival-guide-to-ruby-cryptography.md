## About the speaker

Tony is a member of the Infosec team at Square where he works on Platform Security. He's also the creator of Celluloid, a concurrency library for Ruby based on the Actor Model. When he's not working on cryptography or concurrency, Tony is probably poking around with synthesizers or at a local karaoke bar.

## Talk Abstract

We all know that security is hard, and that math is hard, but what happens when you put them together? Cryptography is an increasingly essential tool for building secure systems, but also a perilous minefield where any number of mistakes can lead to insecure systems.

This talk will take you step-by-step through the difficulties of building secure cryptosystems on top of Ruby's existing OpenSSL bindings and contrast that with RbNaCl, a next generation Ruby cryptography library specifically designed to be more mistake-proof and put cryptography "on Rails". Attendees will hopefully learn that the best approaches to cryptography rest in making systems simple, straightforward, and boring... in a good way.
