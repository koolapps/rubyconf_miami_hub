## About The Speaker
André thinks Ruby is pretty cool. He designs and builds web applications at
Cloud City Development by day, and works on Bundler and Rubygems by night… and
also some days.

## Talk Abstract
Rubygems.org provides every Rubyist with an amazing service: all the libraries
in the Ruby world. As amazing as that is, installing gems can be a
time-consuming and even error-prone process. (Just ask the Travis guys.) In this
talk, you'll learn about the recent dramatic changes in Rubygems and Bundler to
improve speed and reliability by rewriting the Rubygems client/server
architecture. I'll show how the new system caches more information, makes fewer
requests, and takes less time to install gems. Finally, I'll cover how the
changes allow worldwide mirrors of rubygems.org, improving things for Rubyists
around the globe.
