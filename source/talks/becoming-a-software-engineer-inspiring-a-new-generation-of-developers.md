## Talk Abstract

In my wildest dreams, I never thought that I would become a software developer. I thought that I wasn't smart enough, that I needed a computer science degree and to have been writing code since I was young. But, the traditional path to becoming a developer is changing. This talk will focus on alternative and untraditional paths to becoming a developer such as programs like Railsbridge, mentorship and apprentice programs. These alternative paths ultimately foster a more diverse and inclusive community, which drives economic growth and produces more innovative solutions. 
The objectives of the talk are: 
- to bring awareness to the educational alternatives to computer science degrees 
- to encourage empathy when mentoring a beginner 
- to get the audience to see a different perspective and embrace differences in the industry
