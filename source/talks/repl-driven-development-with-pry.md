## About the speaker

Conrad is a developer-tools fanatic. He's a co-maintainer of Pry, most of its plugins, the mail gem, and numerous other libraries in Ruby and beyond. His over-arching focus is on making developers better at their jobs, so when he's not writing open source he works on making Bugsnag the best hosted exception tracking tool around.

## Talk Abstract

Pry is a featureful irb replacement that provides Ruby programmers with a seriously souped-up REPL.

Using some real-life examples, I'll explain how to use Pry to program more effectively.

We'll start with the basics of exploring libaries and experimenting with code at lightning speed. Then we'll move up a level and discuss how to dig into, debug and even modify existing programs. Finally we'll cover a few of the plugins that make Pry a truly indispensible tool.
