## About the speaker

I fell in love with programming as a young boy watching my dad work in Clipper and dBase III (no, really). The obsession sparked there continues to this day. My current language crushes are Ruby and Haskell, and I work for New Relic on the Ruby Agent. When not at work, I enjoy experimenting with programming languages, cycling, homebrewing, and hanging out with my family.

## Talk Abstract

One strength of the Ruby community is the simplicity of sharing code via gems. When a gem is popular enough, it can even develop an ecosystem of additional gems that build on it.

But extending a gem that wasn't built with that flexibility in mind isn't always easy. This talk highlights tips and techniques for making your gem simpler to plug into, and avoid mistakes that will have devs cursing under their breath.

We'll cover the highs and lows of interacting with others gems, from configuration to documentation and everywhere in between.
